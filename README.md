# 🌐 Task Management System – Frontend

This is the **frontend application** for the **Task Management System**.  
It is built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
The frontend communicates with the backend (Express.js + MongoDB) via REST APIs to provide a smooth user experience.

# 🛠️ Design Choices

Email Verification System: Implemented to ensure only valid users can access the platform and to enhance account security.

JWT Authentication: Chosen for stateless, scalable authentication. Tokens are generated for access and refresh sessions.

Express + TypeScript: Provides type safety and a better developer experience.

MongoDB (Mongoose): Flexible document-based database for storing user and task data.

Separation of Concerns: Authentication, middleware, and task management are modularized for a clean architecture.

# ⚖️ Trade-offs & Assumptions

JWT over Sessions:
I chose JWT tokens for security and scalability. They allow stateless authentication, but the trade-off is that token invalidation is harder compared to session-based auth.

Access & Refresh Tokens:
I used short-lived access tokens for requests and long-lived refresh tokens for renewing sessions, balancing security vs. usability.

Email Provider Assumption:
Assumed that SMTP credentials (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) would be available for email verification and password reset flows.

# ⚡ Challenges

Email Sending Issue on Vercel
When deploying the backend on Vercel, the email service did not work properly because serverless functions restrict long-running connections (like SMTP).

✅ Solution: I deployed the backend on Render, which supports persistent connections and SMTP, and kept the frontend on Vercel. This solved the email verification & password reset issue.

CORS Configurations
Had to explicitly configure CORS in Express to allow communication between frontend (Next.js) and backend (Render).

# ✅ Need Future Improvements

Add task categories & priority levels.

Add real-time updates with WebSockets (Socket.IO).

Implement unit & integration tests with Jest.

Deploy frontend (Next.js) + backend (Express) together in Docker for easier scaling.
